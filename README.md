The Triplesec Diary
==============

This app uses [triplesec encryption](https://keybase.io/triplesec/triplesec_now_in_python.html)
to secure your entries before saving them to localstorage.  The cleartext is never written anywhere, so you should
be safe from anything that isn't watching your screen.

Of course, since this is encryption we're talking, not an account password; if you forget your key you are screwed.
You can't read/decipher your diary and nobody can help you recover your password.  Keep it somewhere safe.
